# ME134 - Advanced Robotics

Description: This is a collection of all of my coding projects from ME134 - Advanced Robotics at Tufts University. I took this course in the first semester of my Master's in Human-Robot Interaction out of requirement. However, I have been looking forward to this class for a few years now because I hope it will be a launching pad for what I hope will be a fullfilling career in the exhilerating field of robotics. I hope you enjoy my work.
